# GSV001 diagnostic code

## Message text

``Waited but couldn't find file 'value'.``

## Description

This occurs when a project launches the solution versioning project to build the solution versioning information
file but, after a waiting, the file still does not exist.
This has been know to occur when the build host has insufficient cores available to launch another project build
from within a project.

## Resolution

Try increasing the number of cores available to the build host and try rebuilding again.

Check build logs for if the solution versioning project did build and if it failed to build.

If the problem is an error in the solution versioning project, you can delete the `.git2semver` folder in the solution
versioning project's folder and build the solution versioning project alone.
This will help diagnose the problem.
