## Building documentation

The documentation is build by [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).

Build a local preview from project's root folder with the command line:

```winbatch
docfx Documentation/docfx.json --serve
```

Preview and when ready run this command from the Documentation project folder to rebuild the website:

```winbatch
docfx Documentation/docfx.json
```

Documentation is published from the main branch by a GitHub action.
