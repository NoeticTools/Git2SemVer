# Getting Started

Changelogs are generated by the [Git2SemVer.Tool](xref:git2semver-tool-landing),
instruction to install are [here](xref:git2semver-tool-getting-started).

To generate a changelog, in a directory in your repository, run:

```console
git2semver changelog
```

A changelog in the current directory named `CHANGELOG.md` will be created with any changes
described by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) since the last release.

It also created a directory `.git2semver/changelog` to hold [data files](xref:changelog-data-files) that 
will be used when later updating the changelog.
All of these files should be added to the repository.

As changes are made and committed using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/),
the new changes will be added to the changelog.
You can groom the changelog and rerun the command and your changes will not be lost.

To customise the changelog see [Customising](xref:changelog-customising).

For more information on usign the changelog generator see [Workflows](uid:changelog-workflows).
