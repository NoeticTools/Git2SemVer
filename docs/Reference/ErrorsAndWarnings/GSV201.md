# GSV201 diagnostic code

## Message text

``The last run data file (value.g2sv.data.g.json) must exist in the data directory 'value'.``

## Description

The occurs when the changelog's last run data file cannot be loaded. 
The given data directory (value) may be incorrect or the last run data file (value.g2sv.data.g.json) may not be added to the repository.

## Resolution

If this is the first time the generator has been run then it is safe to ignore.

Otherwise, check that the last run data file (value.g2sv.data.g.json) exists. If it does, open it in an editor to see if the JSON formating is corrupted.
If it does not exist add the last run data file (value.g2sv.data.g.json), that the generator has created, to the repository

Ensure that the data directory option used is correct.
