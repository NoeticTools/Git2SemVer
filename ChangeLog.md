# Git2SemVer.MSBuild Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.0.0 [NEXT]

This release has breaking changes that will impact users that are either:
* Using the generated JSON `Git2SemVer.VersionInfo.g.json` file in custom code.
* Using the Git API in custom C# script (csx) code.

### Added

* C# scripting (csx):
  * `IGitTool` fluent API added ([#5](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.Core/issues/5)).
  * `IGitTool` functionality to get commits between revision ranges ([#5](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.Core/issues/5)).

### Changed

* **Breaking change** to generated JSON file `Git2SemVer.VersionInfo.g.json`. These will only impact users using this file externally.
    * CommitId `Id` property renamed to `Sha`.
    * `CommitChangeTypeId` enumb `None` value (1) added. All higher numbers bumped.
    * `Rev` bumped to `2`.
* **Breaking change** `IGitTool` method signatures changed. Introduced Fluent API.
* TeamCity automatic build label updating now adds build number metadata to release build label, e.g: 1.2.3+34567 ([#33](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/33)). 

## 1.2.0 - _November 26, 2024_

### Changed

* Changed the build system label, as used by TeamCity, to include build number on release builds (#33).
* Moved Git2SemVer.Tool (dotnet tool) code to its own repository.

### Known Issues

* Versioning fails build when TeamCity build configuration's VCS Root uses the option "Use tags as branches" is set ([#32](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/32)). A compile time exception is thrown.

 
## 1.1.0 - _November 16, 2024_

### Added

* Added [Cross targeted projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/multiple-target-frameworks-project-file) support ([#26](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/26)).
* Added versioning log file ([#26](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/2)).
* Added [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) support for versioning.

### Fixed

* On an uncontrolled host with solution open in Visual Studio, build number updates in background every few seconds ([#28](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/28)).
* On an uncontrolled host prior build number is reused on first build after new clone ([#27](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/27)).
* ([#24](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/24)).


### Known Issues

* Solution configured using `Git2SemVer.Tool` dotnet tool 1.0.0 does not allow for `Git2SemVer.MSBuild` package. Requires manual correction ([#25](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/25)).
